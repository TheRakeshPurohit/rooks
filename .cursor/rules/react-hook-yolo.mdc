A hook must be export by name.

First ensure that the hook has a comprehensive test suite. If there are no tests yet, first add test cases in the packages/rooks/src/__tests__ directory.

When ran in the terminal within the packages/rooks directory with pnpm test-hooks hookName eg `pnpm test-hooks useWillUnmount`, all the tests should pass.

If tests don't pass, update the hook until all the tests pass. 

 This project is a mono repo, with rooks being the main package. The hooks are present in the src/hooks folder of the package. The tests are present in src/__tests__ folder of the rooks package. The rooks package is in the packages folder. 

See [useClipboard.ts](mdc:packages/rooks/src/hooks/useClipboard.ts) to understand how we write hooks.
See [useClipboard.spec.tsx](mdc:packages/rooks/src/__tests__/useClipboard.spec.tsx) for inspiration on how to write tests for a hook. 

Write fully typesafe code. Writing any / unknown is not allowed. Only in test cases mocking situations, you can use any/unknown, but only if there is no better option.
